   - For Debian-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu), run:

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nodejs npm
     ```

   - For Red Hat-based distributions (e.g., Fedora), run:

     ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open your terminal and run:

     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

## 2. Clone the Git Repository

1. **Install Git (if not already installed):**
   - **Windows & macOS:**
     - Download and install Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/).
   - **Linux:**
     - Install Git using your package manager:

       ```bash

       sudo apt install git
       ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository (replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the Git repository):

     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```

   - For example:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
     ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Change into the directory of the cloned repository:

     ```bash
     cd your-repository
     ```

4. **Install Project Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install the necessary Node.js dependencies defined in the `package.json` file:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
     
5. **Start the Application:**
   - Run the following command to start the application:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   - This will generate a QR code in the terminal, which you can scan using WhatsApp to link it.

## Summary

You have successfully installed Node.js, cloned the Git repository, and installed the project dependencies. You can now proceed to develop or run the application as needed.
